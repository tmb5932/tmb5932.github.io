          Hello! I'm Travis Brown. I love diving into the world of software
          development and technology, always eager to learn and explore new
          things. Whether I'm working on embedded systems with the RIT Electric
          Vehicle Team or tinkering with new programming languages, I enjoy
          every moment of the journey. <br /><br />
          When I'm not coding, you might find me playing Spikeball,
          participating in the RIT Dodgeball Club, playing chess, or solving
          puzzles. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd
          like to collaborate or chat. Thanks for stopping by!

          KwziiCasino is an entertaining and interactive project I created to
          simulate various casino games. Developed using Java and JavaFX, it
          aims to provide an engaging experience with a diverse range of games
          and activities. The project features classic casino games such as
          blackjack, horse betting, and slots, as well as fun extras like coin
          flips and a solvable Rubik’s Cube. This was my first attempt at a project 
          that wasn't a simple homework assignment, and I learned a lot from it.

        <p class="project-desc">
          Developed a dynamic, interactive course planning tool using Flask (Python), 
          JS, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. This web application allows students to 
          customize and visualize their course schedules. Inspired by the rigid course 
          flowcharts provided by my university, I developed this tool to offer a more 
          flexible and personalized course planning experience. Instead of manually 
          editing text files every semester, students can now visually organize their 
          academic path in a more efficient and interactive way.

          them. It also provides a visual representation of my spending habits,
          allowing me to see where my money is going month by month.

        <p class="project-desc">
          This project was created to speed up my enrollment into my selected
          classes for the next semester. Due to many students getting access to
          enrolling in classes at the same time, it turns into a race. This
          script uses Selenium to help speed up enrolling in the classes I want,
          to improve my chances of getting in. It is designed for automating the
          enrollment process in RIT's online academic portal (SIS).

          Currency Mod is a Minecraft mod that significantly enhances

          unique items, custom storage items, and new interactive blocks. With
          custom menus, block textures and crafting recipes, this mod is my
          exploration and experimentation with Minecraft modding.

        Studio TVWT is a command-line interface (CLI) designed to interact with 
        a PostgreSQL-based movies database. The project allows users to manage 
        movies, rate them, create collections, follow users, track watch history, 
        and receive personalized recommendations based on play history and community trends.
        This was created as a semester-long project for my Principles of Data Management course,
        with a similar idea to Goodreads, but for movies. Completed with a team of 3 peers.

      U-Fund is a web-based donation platform designed to support a non-profit homeless 
      shelter by streamlining the donation process. Developed as a team project, this 
      application allows users to buy items based on the shelter's needs through a 
      digital "cupboard." Built with an Angular front-end and a Java Spring backend, 
      this project was a valuable full-stack experience. Completed with a team of 3 peers
      following Scrum methodology.
