          Hello! I'm Travis Brown. I love diving into the world of software
          development and technology, always eager to learn and explore new
          things. Whether I'm working on embedded systems with the RIT Electric
          Vehicle Team or tinkering with new programming languages, I enjoy
          every moment of the journey. <br /><br />
          When I'm not coding, you might find me playing Spikeball,
          participating in the RIT Dodgeball Club, playing chess, or solving
          puzzles. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd
          like to collaborate or chat. Thanks for stopping by!

        <h2 class="project-title">Selection Menu Chip8 ROM</h2>
        <h3 class="project-type">Personal Project</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          After creating my Chip8 emulator, I wanted to make my own ROM, not only partially because I wanted to write a program in assembly.
          This ROM is a menu that gives a dynamic number of options fed into the memory of the Chip8 before the ROM was started. It allows the user
          to select an option, and that option is available to the Emulator program to do something with. In my case, I use it to select what game I wanted to play.
          <br>I used <a class="internal-link" target="_blank" href="https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/">John Earnest's Octo</a> to make this.

        <p class="project-desc">
          Using the Chip8 emulator I created, I made a retro-inspired handheld console. Built on a Raspberry Pi 5, SSD1309 OLED display, a custom-designed 4x4 keypad, and an active buzzer for sound. 
          Designed and engineered from scratch, this Game Boy-style device brings classic Chip-8 games to life in a portable form.

        <h3 class="project-type">Personal Project</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Created in Rust, this program emulates a Chip8, which is a virtual machine from the '70s. That technically makes this an interpreter, but whatever.
          This was my first time using Rust, or making an emulator, so the process was probably slower than it otherwise would have been, but I learned a lot about Rust and the internals of computers.
          The emulator uses SDL2 to display graphics, audio, and keyboard input.

          KwziiCasino is an entertaining and interactive project I created to
          simulate various casino games. Developed using Java and JavaFX, it
          aims to provide an engaging experience with a diverse range of games
          and activities. The project features classic casino games such as
          blackjack, horse betting, and slots, as well as fun extras like coin
          flips and a solvable Rubik’s Cube. This was my first attempt at a project 
          that wasn't a simple homework assignment, and I learned a lot from it.

        <h3 class="project-type">Personal Project</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Developed a dynamic, interactive course planning tool using Flask (Python), 
          JS, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. This web application allows students to 
          customize and visualize their course schedules. Inspired by the rigid course 
          flowcharts provided by my university, I developed this tool to offer a more 
          flexible and personalized course planning experience. Instead of manually 
          editing text files every semester, students can now visually organize their 
          academic path in a more efficient and interactive way.

        <p class="project-desc">
          This project was created to speed up my enrollment into my selected
          classes for the next semester. Due to many students getting access to
          enrolling in classes at the same time, it turns into a race. This
          script uses Selenium to help speed up enrolling in the classes I want,
          to improve my chances of getting in. It is designed for automating the
          enrollment process in RIT's online academic portal (SIS).

          Coded using Java and JSON, the mod features custom villager trades,
          unique items, custom storage items, and new interactive blocks. With
          custom menus, block textures and crafting recipes, this mod is my

          and receive personalized recommendations based on play history and community trends.
          This was created as a semester-long project for my Principles of Data Management course,
          with a similar idea to Goodreads, but for movies. Completed with a team of 3 peers.

          U-Fund is a web-based donation platform designed to support a non-profit homeless

          digital "cupboard." Built with an Angular front-end and a Java Spring backend, 
          this project was a valuable full-stack experience. Completed with a team of 3 peers
          following Scrum methodology.
